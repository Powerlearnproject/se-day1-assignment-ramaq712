Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the application of engineering principles,and maintanance of high quality software system.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Rise of agile methodologies
2. Development of programming languages
3. Advent of structured programming

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Implementation; it is the building the software and writing code according to the design specified
2. Deployment; it is whereby the software is released to users or customers.
3. Design: it is the Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall methodologies ; is the planning of everything from start and each phase must be completed before moving to the next. e.g like building a house 
Agile methodologies; is the process where work is done in small cycles and allowing of continuous changes and feedbacks e.g mobile app development .


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer ; is responsible for writing , testing and maintaining code to build software application. Ensures software runs smoothly.
Quality Assurance Engineer; is responsible for testing and finding bugs and report before released. They ensure the software meets quality standards by performing manual and automated tests.
A Project Manager ; is responsible for planning, organizing, and overseeing the entire software development process. They coordinate tasks, manage timelines, and ensure the team meets deadlines



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments are important because they provide a complete set of tools for writing, debugging, and testing code in one place i.e VS Code
Version Control Systems (VCS) are essential because they track changes to code, allowing developers to collaborate. i.e Github



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays. The solution is to communicate effevtively
 Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality. The solution is to  regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.
 Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs. The solution is to prioritization of tasks.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
 Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software. its importance is helps catch bugs early and makes debugging easier.
 Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems. its importance is ensures that combined parts function correctly as a system.
 System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole. Its importance is it ensures the whole system works as expected before release.
 Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs. Its improtance is it confirms the software is ready for deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. Prompt engineering helps avoid that by making your questions clear and specific.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
A vague prompt is where the instructions are unclear, making it hard to understand what is required. i.e ,Create a report about technology.
While an improved promt shows i.e Write a 2-page report on how Artificial Intelligence is transforming the healthcare industry. Include examples of AI applications, benefits, and potential challenges.
The improved prompt is more effective because it provides a clear topic, defines the expected length, and outlines key areas to cover. This ensures the final output meets expectations and reduces confusion.
